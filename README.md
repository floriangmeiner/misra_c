# Understanding MISRA-C

These are some notes where I simplify (probably too much) the MISRA-C rules.

See the [notes](./notes.md) for my terse interpretation. 

## To-do's
- [ ] Provide links to examples of compliant and non-compliant code. 
- [ ] Provide links to tooling for code analysis and compliance automation.

Cheers,
